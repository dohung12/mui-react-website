    'Founded in 2019, we’re ready to get our hands on the world’s business problems.',
    'It all started with one question: Why aren’t all businesses using available technology? There are many different answers to that question: economic barriers, social barriers, educational barriers, and sometimes institutional barriers.',
    'We aim to be a powerful force in overcoming these obstacles. Recent developments in software engineering and computing power, compounded by the proliferation of smart phones, has opened up infinite worlds of possibility. Things that have always been done by hand can now be done digitally and automatically, and completely new methods of interaction are created daily. Taking full advantage of these advancements is the name of the game.',
    '  All this change can be a lot to keep up with, and that’s where we come in.',
